# SQL Injection Vulnerability Project

## Project Structure
The project simulates a basic web application with a database, containing both a vulnerable SQL Injection endpoint and a secured one. Below is the structure of the project:


- **`app.py`**: Contains the backend logic for the application, with both a vulnerable SQL injection route and a secured route.
- **`database.db`**: SQLite database to store user data for demonstration.
- **`templates/index.html`**: HTML form for user input (username and password) to test login functionality.

---

## Technologies Needed
To build and run this project, you'll need the following technologies:

### Backend
- **Python 3.x**: Programming language used to write the Flask web application.
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for Python to create web applications.
- **SQLite**: Simple and lightweight relational database for storing and querying user data.

### Frontend
- **HTML**: For creating basic web forms that interact with the backend.

### Security Tools (for Prevention)
- **Parameterized Queries**: To prevent SQL Injection by safely passing user inputs to the database query.

## Additional Tools
- **pip**: Python package manager to install dependencies.
- **SQLite Database Browser (Optional)**: A tool to view and manage the SQLite database.
